## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: [security@quantum-banking.com]

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Never commit secrets** or credentials to the repository
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Follow secure coding practices** (OWASP guidelines)
4. **Validate all inputs** and sanitize outputs
5. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
6. **Implement proper error handling** without information disclosure
7. **Keep dependencies updated** and scan for vulnerabilities

### For Deployment
1. **Use strong passwords** and rotate them regularly
2. **Enable all security features** in production
3. **Monitor security logs** and set up alerts
4. **Keep systems updated** with security patches
5. **Use network segmentation** and firewalls
6. **Implement backup and recovery** procedures
7. **Conduct regular security assessments**

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial response and acknowledgment
3. **Day 3-7**: Vulnerability assessment and validation
4. **Day 8-30**: Development of fix and testing
5. **Day 31-45**: Release of security patch
6. **Day 46-90**: Public disclosure (coordinated)
