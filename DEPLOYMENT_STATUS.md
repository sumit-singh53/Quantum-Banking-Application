cd auth-validation
python run_validation.py --mode validate --environment dev
```

### 3. Load Testing Framework
```bash
# Can run load tests against any endpoint
cd scripts
python load-testing.py --base-url http://localhost:3000 --test-type health --duration 30
```

### 4. Development Scripts
```bash
# Various development and deployment scripts available
scripts/
├── run-final-validation.ps1     # Windows validation script
├── final-deployment-validation.sh # Linux validation script
├── load-testing.py              # Load testing framework
├── production-hardening.sh      # Production hardening
└── final-integration-tests.sh   # Integration testing
```

## 🐳 To Deploy Full System (Requires Docker)

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Development)
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop first
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize databases
./scripts/init-databases.sh

# Access services
# - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Vault UI: http://localhost:8200
```

### Option 2: Kubernetes (Production)
```bash
# Deploy complete system
./scripts/deploy-complete-system.sh

# Or use Makefile
make deploy
```
